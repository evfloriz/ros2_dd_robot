## ros2_dd_robot

This repository is for development and experimentation with ROS2 on my differential drive robot. The plan for this project is to create a functional differential drive robot system with both sim and real development.
Control is handled by a ros2_control differential drive controller.

Based on ROS2 Humble and Gazebo Fortress.

Inspired by the Articulated Robotics mobile robot tutorials. ([link](https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/tutorials/))

#### TODO

- <s>Create URDF based on real robot</s>
- <s>Get teleop control working using ros2_control in gz sim</s>
- Get teleop control working using ros2_control on real robot
